# HELICS-FMI

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/8pt3yp3tveflmj3s/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/phlptp/helics-fmi/branch/master) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-FMI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-FMI)

Executable to allow Functional Mockup units to interact with [HELICS](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS)

## Building

HELICS-FMI uses cmake for build system generation.  It requires HELICS 2.1 or greater to operate.  

### Windows
For building with Visual Studio the cmake-gui is recommended.  
Set the build directory to an empty path, for example HELICS-FMI/build, and the source directory to the HELICS-FMI directory.  
HELICS-FMI will attempt to locate an existing HELICS installation and use those files.  If one does not exist HELICS will automatically download and build it.

### Linux and others
The process is the same as for Windows, with the exception that HELICS will not automatically build unless the AUTOBUILD_HELICS option is enabled.
