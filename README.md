Executable to allow Functional Mockup units to interact with [HELICS](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS)

## Building

HELICS-FMI uses cmake for build system generation. It requires HELICS 3.3 or greater to operate.

### Windows

For building with Visual Studio the cmake-gui is recommended.
Set the build directory to an empty path, for example HELICS-FMI/build, and the source directory to the HELICS-FMI directory.
HELICS-FMI will attempt to locate an existing HELICS installation and use those files. If one does not exist HELICS will automatically download and build it.

### Linux and others

The process is the same as for Windows, with the exception that HELICS will not automatically build unless the AUTOBUILD_HELICS option is enabled.
